# Complete Project

### Objective:
Practice some steps of the ML process.

### ML Details:
- Supervised learning
- Multi-class classification

### Important notes:
- For the EDA and feature selection I'm using R.
- For modeling, hyperparameter tuning and prediction I'm using Python.
- For the preliminar model performance testing no hyperparameter tuning was performed and no dataset splitting was done too. For this purpose 10-Fold Cross-Validation was used.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
I'm trying to use Bayesian Optimization, but the computational resources needed are bigger than the available ones. Keep trying ...

### Models Tested:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Suport Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
