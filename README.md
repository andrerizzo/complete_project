# Complete Project
There is not much creativity in this title but that's ok. </br>
***It is under construction, so updates will be uploaded as far as new features were added.***

### Objective:
Practice some steps of the ML process.

### ML Details:
- Supervised learning
- Multi-class classification

### Important notes:
- For the EDA and feature selection I'm using R.
- For modeling, hyperparameter tuning and prediction I'm using Python.
- For the preliminar model performance testing no hyperparameter tuning was performed and no dataset splitting was done too. For this purpose 10-Fold Cross-Validation was used.

### Models Tested:
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Suport Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)

### Model Selection Criteria:
Models with the first four best scores were selected and hyperparameter tuning will be performed, prior to the definite model training. 

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
Bayesian Optimization was used with the implementation of tune-sklearn library
