# Complete Project

## Objective:
Practice some steps from the ML process.

## ML Details:
Supervised Model

## Important notes:
- For the EDA and feature selection I'm using R.
- For modeling, hyperparameter tuning and prediction I'm using Python.

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
I'm trying to use Bayesian Optimization, but the computational resources needed as bigger than the available ones.
